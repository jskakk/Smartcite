# SmartCite Frontend

This is a small React (Vite) frontend to pair with the existing Spring Boot backend in the parent project.

Quick start (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd .\Smartcite\frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend expects the backend to be running at `http://localhost:8080` and uses `/api/*` endpoints.
